About Kensaku
---
Kensaku is a very easy tool to manage your local cloud. In a near future,
it will also support real cloud.

Release after release we're adding new features and "solutions"! Even 
though some commands (like add-relation) don't have any real use yet,
they're a placeholder for future commands.

For further info, run

    kensaku -h

About the Solutions
---
A solution is an easy way to install something to your website. For example,
you just have to do:

    kensaku deploy wordpress

And you'll have a wordpress folder in your site with all your files!

A list with all the available and updated solutions is in the Changelog file.
